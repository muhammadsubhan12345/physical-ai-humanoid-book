## Definition of Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are **embedded in physical machines** capable of sensing, moving, and interacting with the real world.

Unlike traditional AI systems that operate only in digital environments, Physical AI exists inside **robots, autonomous systems, and smart machines**.

These systems do not only think — they **perceive, decide, and act**.

---

## Core Characteristics

A Physical AI system has the following characteristics:

- Sensors to perceive the environment
- Actuators to perform physical actions
- Control systems to manage movement
- AI models to make decisions
- Feedback loops to correct behavior

All of these components must work together in real time.

## Why Physical AI is Difficult

Physical AI systems face challenges that software AI does not:

- Uncertainty in the real world
- Noisy sensor data
- Hardware limitations
- Safety-critical decisions
- Real-time constraints

A small error in code can cause **real physical damage**.

## Real-World Examples

Examples of Physical AI systems include:

- Humanoid robots
- Self-driving cars
- Industrial robotic arms
- Drones and delivery robots
- Medical assistive robots

These systems combine AI with mechanical and electrical engineering.

## Key Takeaways

- Physical AI combines intelligence with physical embodiment
- It operates in unpredictable real-world environments
- Safety, control, and reliability are critical
- It is the foundation of humanoid robotics
