## Sensors

Sensors allow a robot to perceive the world.

Common sensors include:
- Cameras (vision)
- Microphones (audio)
- Touch sensors
- Force and torque sensors
- IMUs (orientation)

Sensors provide raw data to the AI system.

---

## Actuators

Actuators allow a robot to move.

Examples include:
- Electric motors
- Hydraulic systems
- Pneumatic systems

They convert AI decisions into physical motion.

---

## Control Systems

Control systems connect sensors and actuators.

They:
- Maintain balance
- Control speed and force
- Correct errors using feedback

Control is essential for safe operation.

## Key Takeaways

- Sensors enable perception
- Actuators enable action
- Control systems link perception and action
- Together they form the robot body
