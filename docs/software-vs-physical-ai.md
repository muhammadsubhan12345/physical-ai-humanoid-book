## Software AI

Software AI systems operate entirely in digital environments.

Examples include:
- Chatbots
- Recommendation systems
- Search engines
- Image and text generation models

They process data and produce outputs without interacting physically with the world.

---

## Physical AI

Physical AI systems exist inside machines that interact with the real world.

They must:
- Sense the environment
- Make decisions
- Perform physical actions
- Handle uncertainty and noise

Mistakes have physical consequences.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Software AI | Physical AI |
|------|------------|------------|
| Environment | Digital | Real world |
| Risk | Low | High |
| Timing | Flexible | Real-time |
| Failure | Retry possible | Dangerous |

## Why Physical AI Requires New Skills

Engineers working on Physical AI must understand:
- AI and machine learning
- Robotics and hardware
- Control systems
- Safety and ethics

This makes Physical AI a multidisciplinary field.
